          Information about our users is an important part of our business and
          we are not in the business of selling our users` personal information
          to others. 724Desk shares users` personal information only as
          described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of 724Desk
          that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
          least as protective as those described in this{' '}
          <span style={{ color: '#2485E8' }}> Privacy Notice.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Third party service providers: We employ other companies and
          individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
          analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments,
          transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These
          third-party service providers only have access to personal information
          needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
          purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
          accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by
          applicable data protection laws.
          <br />
          <br />
          Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might
          sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user
          information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
          remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
          Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the
          unlikely event that 724Desk or substantially all of its assets are
          acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.
          <br />
          <br />
          Protection of 724Desk and others: We release account and other
          personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
          with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our
          Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or
          safety of 724Desk, our users or others. This includes exchanging
          information with other companies and organisations for fraud
          protection and credit risk reduction.
